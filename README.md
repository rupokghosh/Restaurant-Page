# Restaurant-Page

This is a website designed for a restaurant, the Afro-Indian Restaurant. 
This website is made purely using HTML, CSS, and JS. This website is also made without the
use of CSS Flexbox in order for me to grasp a better understanding of CSS Grid. 

## Pages

1. [home page] (index.html)
2. [menu] (menu.html)
3. [contact page] (contact.html)
4. [locations page] (location.html)
5. [reservation] (reservation.html)

This website was created as a final project for an introduction to web development course in 
my college. It takes inspiration from both the African and the Indian cuisine.
